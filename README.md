### CMSC 495 Bookkeeping Project ###

#### Overview ####

This project, the central focus of the UMUC capstone class CMSC 495 Current Trends and Projects in Computer Science, is an implementation of a simple bookkeeping system powered by a variety of different technologies and languages, ranging from PHP to JavaScript. Developed over a period of seven weeks, the project was implemented by a group of six developers split into two teams. The front-end team was tasked with designing the application's look and feel via CSS and developing the application's REST-compliant handling of user input and back-end integration via JavaScript. The back-end team oversaw the development of the database structure and the implementation of a set of RESTful endpoints facilitating interaction between the front and back-ends.

The finished product provides small business owners with a dynamic set of tools to manage documents and financial transactions with ease. By creating and logging into a unique user account, clients may input new customers, vendors, documents, and financial accounts and view their extant entries in a set of tables located in the interface dashboard. Users may view a collated overview listing of their documents or choose to look at the specific financial transactions that make up individual documents in a double-entry general ledger format. Additional functionality permits the printing of the currently viewed table for paper records and the changing of the user account password at will.
